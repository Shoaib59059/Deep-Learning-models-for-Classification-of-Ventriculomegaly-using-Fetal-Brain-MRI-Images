## Models

### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

The CNN architecture is employed as the primary deep-learning model for image classification. CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks, and their hierarchical feature learning enables accurate detection of abnormalities in fetal brain ultrasound images.

### CNN Variations

#### 1. **Modified CNN Architecture**

A customized CNN architecture with specific modifications tailored to enhance performance in fetal brain ultrasound image classification.

#### 2. **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNN Models**

Utilizing pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) and fine-tuning them on the fetal brain ultrasound dataset for improved efficiency and accuracy.

## eXplainable AI (XAI)

### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

LIME is employed for model interpretability by generating locally faithful explanations for individual predictions. It perturbs input data and observes the impact on model predictions, providing insights into the decision boundaries.

### Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)

Grad-CAM is utilized to visualize the regions of fetal brain ultrasound images that are crucial for classification decisions. It highlights important areas, enhancing transparency and understanding of the model's focus.

### Theory

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for image-based tasks. They consist of convolutional layers that learn hierarchical features from input images, making them highly effective for image classification tasks.

#### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

LIME is an XAI technique that explains the predictions of machine learning models. It works by generating perturbed samples of the input data, observing the model's behavior on these samples, and fitting a local interpretable model to approximate the black-box model.

#### Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)

Grad-CAM produces visual explanations by leveraging the gradients of the target class with respect to the model's feature maps. It highlights the regions in an image that contribute most to the decision-making process.
